======================

##Description
Ammo is a centralized music library that allows you to build playlists containing songs from all of your favorite music services. 
If you’d like to make playlists that mix mainstream services (e.g. rdio, spotify) with lesser known indie tracks (e.g. soundcloud),  Ammo is for you.

Ammo allows everyone at your party to participate in democratic DJ-ing, changing the way you listen to music at parties.

Picture yourself at a party. The music is pumping and you’re dancing with your friends, and you want to hear your favorite song. Is it on the current playlist? Does the host even have the song? With Ammo, you can pull out your phone and check to see if your song is coming up in the current playlist. You can even up-vote that song so that it plays sooner. And if it’s not on the list, you can do a quick search for it, and add it to the playlist yourself. No need to leave the dance floor to make a DJ request, no need to wonder when, if ever, your song will play. It all happens with a few clicks and within a few seconds. Only on Ammo.

- SoundCloud
- Rdio
